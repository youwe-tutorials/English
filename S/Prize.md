### Describe a prize that you received

You should say
- What it was
- When you received it
- What did you do for it
- And explain how you felt about it

I have always believed working hard and not worrying about the outcomes. Said that, getting a prize is always very encouraging and hence pushes one to keep working hard.

I have been fortunate and blessed that I have been awarded quite a good number of times. But a win which I can never forget in my lifetime happened more than a decade ago in 2008. At that time, I was in grade 11 and was admitted in a new school after my 10th. Being in a new school, I was really holding up myself as I was missing my previous school's friends and teachers. To cover up, I took part in Intra-School Debate contest and I stood first in the contest. That's not the end. This brought me to the notice of teachers of my new school. That was a point when they shortlisted me for participating in an International Students' Science Fair to be held at Lucknow. I along with a mentor and other two team members worked really hard for around 3 months preparing for the research topic and an Oral Presentation Contest to be held at the fair. We literally burned the midnight oil for it. All our hard work bore fruit when our team leaded by me was announced for the first prize for Oral presentation out of over 100 teams from around 20 different countries. Our team members along with our mentor were thrilled.

This victory was **beyond my wildest dreams**. I still get **goose bumps** when I remember that moment. We received a beautiful metal trophy which looked as beautiful as a trophy of an Oscar Award. And the joy was no less than getting the same. I often narrate this beautiful and **elated** moment with my near and dear ones.
