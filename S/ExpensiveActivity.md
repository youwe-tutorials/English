### Describe an expensive activity that you enjoy doing occasionally

You should say
- What it is
- Who do you do it with
- Why is it expensive
- And explain how you feel about it

Well, most of the activities that I am fond of and pursue occasionally are not quite expensive, **albeit**, there are few exorbitantly priced activities which I have never performed but I wish to. To name few, paragliding, sea-diving, river-rafting are at the top of my wish list.

But one activity which I do enjoy occasionally and is often expensive to do is attending **Conferences and Symposiums**. If I recall, I attended an International Conference for the first time in 2013 on being **recommended** by my research supervisor when I was a post-graduate student. I still remember how nervous I was to present my life's very first research paper in front of the august gathering. Me, being a young researcher at that time, the experience was both exciting and enriching for me. Since then, I have been fond of being a part of such Conferences and Symposiums as besides giving an opportunity to present one's research, such events is a great platform to meet and share ideas with like minded people coming from different countries. The **frequency** of my participation in such activities has been **augmented** ever since I enrolled for my PhD.

And at such events, I either go alone or I am accompanied by my co-researchers. And most of these International Conferences are often expensive to be a part of because of more than one reasons. The major expense is of the registration fee which is often between 5000 to 10,000 rupees or even more sometimes i.e may be around $200 - $300. It involves huge amount as it usually includes participation in the technical program, the publication or proceedings charges, conference kit, working lunch and refreshments. And that's not the end. Another major two expenses which are not included in the registration fee are of the accommodation and travel as usually I have to take a flight to reach the destination of the conference.

I truly feel that such events which are for sharing ideas and research are vital and therefore they shouldn't be overpriced. Instead, for encouraging more researchers and scientist to be a part of it, the registration fee should be charged moderately.

Said that, I am fortunate, that most of the time my participation in such events are sponsored by my institute which includes registration, accommodation and travel expenses too. In my opinion, government in general and Ministry of Human Resource development in particular should invest more in policies that are in favour of researchers and hence promote participation in such activities.
